# Testing Roadmap: Proving Universal Phase Transitions

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** Battle plan for the next 4 weeks
**Goal:** Prove this in 3-5 information systems, then get weird

---

## Confirmed So Far

✅ **RCET Simulation** - Phase transitions exist mathematically
✅ **GitHub Repos** - 0.24x vs 19.58x acceleration (reproduced Oct 6, 2025)
⚠️ **Stock Trading** - Noisy/unclear (53.8% on small sample)

---

## The Next Four Tests

### Test 1: Hacker News Posts ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Timeline:** This weekend (4-6 hours)

**Hypothesis:**
Posts that reach 50 upvotes quickly hit front page and get dramatically higher final scores than posts that reach 50 slowly.

**Data Source:**
- Hacker News API: https://github.com/HackerNews/API
- Firebase endpoint: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/
- Full historical data available

**Method:**
```python
# 1. Get top 10,000 stories from past 3 years
# 2. For each story, reconstruct upvote timeline (if possible)
#    OR use proxy: score at 6 hours vs final score
# 3. Measure time-to-50-upvotes
# 4. Compare final scores:
#    - "Instant" (<1 hour to 50)
#    - "Fast" (1-3 hours to 50)
#    - "Gradual" (3-6 hours to 50)
# 5. Calculate acceleration factors
```

**Expected Result:**
- Instant-to-50: avg final score 300+
- Gradual-to-50: avg final score 80
- Ratio: 3-5x difference (maybe higher)

**Success Criteria:**
- Find statistically significant difference (p < 0.01)
- Effect size > 2x
- Pattern holds across different years

**Deliverable:**
- `hn_phase_transition_analysis.py`
- Results markdown with graphs
- Add to evidence collection

### Test 2: Reddit Subreddit Growth ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Timeline:** Week of Oct 13 (3-4 days)

**Hypothesis:**
Subreddits that reach 1,000 subscribers quickly grow dramatically larger than those that reach 1,000 slowly.

**Data Source:**
- Reddit API: https://www.reddit.com/dev/api
- Pushshift (if still available): https://pushshift.io
- OR scrape from /r/newreddits and track growth

**Method:**
```python
# 1. Find subreddits created 2018-2021 (old enough to mature)
# 2. Get subscriber count history (via Archive.org snapshots OR manual tracking)
# 3. Measure days-to-1000-subscribers
# 4. Compare current sizes:
#    - "Instant" (<30 days to 1k)
#    - "Fast" (30-90 days to 1k)
#    - "Gradual" (90-180 days to 1k)
# 5. Calculate growth ratios
```

**Expected Result:**
- Similar to GitHub: 10-20x difference in final size
- Instant-growth subs have 50k+ members
- Gradual-growth subs plateau at 5k

**Challenges:**
- Historical subscriber data hard to get
- May need to use Archive.org snapshots
- OR track current growth rates as proxy

**Success Criteria:**
- 100+ subreddits analyzed
- Clear phase transition pattern
- Reproduces GitHub finding in different domain

**Deliverable:**
- `reddit_growth_analysis.py`
- Dataset of subreddit growth trajectories
- Comparison to GitHub results

---

### Test 3: Academic Paper Citations ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Timeline:** Week of Oct 20 (5-7 days)

**Hypothesis:**
Papers with high citations in year 1 become "classics" with dramatically more long-term impact than slow-start papers.

**Data Source:**
- Semantic Scholar API: https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api
- ArXiv metadata (for preprints)
- OpenCitations (for citation data)

**Method:**
```python
# 1. Sample 5,000 papers from ArXiv (2015-2018, old enough to mature)
# 2. Get citation counts:
#    - Year 1 (first 12 months)
#    - Year 5 (total citations by 2023)
# 3. Categorize by year-1 citations:
#    - "Instant impact" (>20 citations year 1)
#    - "Moderate" (5-20 citations year 1)
#    - "Slow burn" (<5 citations year 1)
# 4. Compare year-5 citation counts
# 5. Look for phase transition
```

**Expected Result:**
- Instant-impact papers: 200+ citations by year 5
- Slow-burn papers: <30 citations by year 5
- Clear stratification, not linear relationship

**Why This Matters:**
- High impact if true (predict important research early)
- Helps funding agencies, researchers prioritize
- Shows pattern in knowledge systems, not just social media

**Success Criteria:**
- 1,000+ papers analyzed
- Find >5x difference in final impact
- Show non-linear relationship (phase transition not gradual)

**Deliverable:**
- `academic_citation_analysis.py`
- Results showing early citations predict classics
- Potential publication in scientometrics journal

---

### Test 4: YouTube Video Growth ⭐⭐⭐

**Timeline:** Week of Oct 27 (if API accessible)

**Hypothesis:**
Videos that get high views in first 24 hours receive algorithmic boost and reach dramatically higher final view counts.

**Data Source:**
- YouTube Data API v3 (requires key)
- May be challenging due to API restrictions
- Alternative: Use publicly available datasets

**Method:**
```python
# 1. Sample 10,000 videos from specific channels/categories
# 2. Get view counts:
#    - 24 hours after upload
#    - 30 days after upload
# 3. Categorize by day-1 performance
# 4. Compare final view counts
# 5. Look for algorithmic boost threshold
```

**Expected Result:**
- Videos crossing X views in 24h get algorithm boost
- Dramatic difference (10x+) in final views
- Clear threshold effect

**Challenges:**
- API access limitations
- Need historical data (not just current snapshots)
- Algorithm changes over time

**Success Criteria:**
- Find evidence of algorithmic boost threshold
- Show phase transition in view growth
- Understand YouTube recommendation dynamics

**Deliverable:**
- `youtube_growth_analysis.py` (if possible)
- OR skip if data unavailable
- Focus on HN/Reddit/Citations instead

## Backup Tests (If Needed)

### Test 5: Twitter/X Post Virality

**Data:** Twitter API (if accessible), academic datasets
**Pattern:** Early retweets predict viral spread
**Challenge:** API access very restricted now

### Test 6: Kickstarter Projects

**Data:** Kickstarter public data
**Pattern:** Early funding velocity predicts final success
**Advantage:** Clean financial outcomes (funded vs not)

### Test 7: Podcast Growth

**Data:** Apple Podcasts charts, Spotify data
**Pattern:** Early subscriber growth predicts long-term success
**Challenge:** Historical data hard to obtain
