# üéØ Patreon Plan - Fund Research, Share CASCADE Signals

**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase
**Goal:** Fund mathematical research while sharing CASCADE trading system

---

## üé® THE CORE CONCEPT

### Primary Mission
Fund ongoing mathematical research into:
- Recursive Contamination Field Theory (RCFT)
- Memory-augmented partition dynamics
- Phase transitions in complex systems
- Open-source mathematical frameworks

### Secondary Benefit
Patreon supporters get early access to research + CASCADE trading scanner/signals

### The Honest Pitch
*"I'm releasing my mathematical research for free (RCFT Week1-3, Descent Engine on GitHub). Patreon funds continued research. As a thank you, supporters get access to CASCADE - an 80% win rate trading system I discovered while studying phase transitions. The edge might degrade if too many people use it, but right now it works."*

## üìã LEGAL DISCLAIMERS (EVERYWHERE)

### Standard Disclaimer (On Every Page)

```
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE: This is educational research sharing. I am not a
registered investment advisor. Nothing here constitutes financial advice.

PAST PERFORMANCE ‚â† FUTURE RESULTS: Backtested results do not guarantee
future performance. The CASCADE system worked historically but may stop
working at any time.

YOU CAN LOSE MONEY: Trading stocks involves substantial risk of loss.
Only trade with money you can afford to lose. Always use stop losses.

EDGE DEGRADATION RISK: If too many people use this system, the edge
may degrade or disappear entirely. This is experimental.

YOUR RESPONSIBILITY: Any trading decisions you make are entirely your
own responsibility. You accept all risk.

By subscribing, you acknowledge these risks and agree to the Terms of Service.
```

### Discord Channel Welcome Message

```
Welcome to the CASCADE research community!

Quick rules:
‚úÖ Share your research, ask questions, discuss setups
‚úÖ Be respectful, we're all learning
‚úÖ Use risk management - stops are mandatory

‚ùå Don't blame others for your losses
‚ùå Don't share this outside the community (kills the edge)
‚ùå Don't ask for personal financial advice

Remember: This is experimental. Trade small. Use stops.

## üéØ PATREON PAGE COPY

### Title
**Mathematical Research + CASCADE Trading Signals**

### Subtitle
*Fund open-source physics research, get access to an 80% win rate trading system*

### About Section

```markdown
# What I'm Building

I'm a mathematical researcher exploring phase transitions, memory dynamics,
and emergent behavior in complex systems.

## Published Work (Free & Open Source):
- **RCFT Week1**: Recursive contamination in memory systems
- **Descent Engine**: Memory-augmented partition dynamics with dreams and forking
- **Phase Transition Theory**: Universal patterns in systems with memory

All published on GitHub with full code, DOIs, and documentation.

## The Discovery

While studying phase transitions, I discovered they occur in stock markets too.
When momentum accumulates past a critical threshold + volume confirms =
explosive move (CASCADE signal).

**Backtested Results (2020-2024):**
- 80.8% win rate on CASCADE signals
- RIOT: 87.5% win rate (14 trades over 4 years)
- PLTR: 80% win rate
- ~4 signals per stock per year (rare but accurate)

## What Patreon Funds

Your support funds:
- Continued mathematical research (Week 4, 5, 6...)
- Open-source releases of frameworks
- Validation of phase transition theory
- Time to research instead of needing a "proper job"

## What You Get

As a thank you, supporters get:
- CASCADE trading scanner + signals
- Research updates and early access
- Community Discord
- Tools I use for my own trading

## The Honest Truth

This edge might degrade. If 1000 people use the same signals, it could stop
working. Right now it works. I'm sharing it with a small community of
supporters who fund the research.

Not financial advice. You can lose money. Trade responsibly.
```

### Welcome Video Script (If You Make One)

```
"Hey, I'm Casey. I study phase transitions - moments when systems with
accumulated memory suddenly change state.

Started with contaminated memories, moved to partition dynamics, discovered
it happens in stock markets too.

When stocks accumulate momentum past 1.15x baseline + volume surges 1.9x,
they're entering a phase transition. Historically, these CASCADE signals
have an 80% win rate.

I'm releasing all my mathematical research for free. Patreon funds that work.

Supporters get the CASCADE scanner as a thank you.

Not financial advice. This is experimental. But the physics are real and
the backtests work.

If you want to support weird mathematical research AND potentially profit
from it, welcome aboard."

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK MANAGEMENT

### Edge Degradation Monitoring

Track monthly:
- Win rate vs historical baseline
- Signal frequency changes
- Price action quality
- Community size growth

**Transparency promise:** If win rate drops below 60% for 2 months,
announce edge degradation publicly. Offer refunds or pivot to new signals.

### Community Size Cap

Consider capping total members at 500 to preserve edge quality.
"Waitlist" creates scarcity + protects effectiveness.

### Alternative Value If Edge Dies

If CASCADE stops working:
- Still have: Research updates, new frameworks
- Pivot to: New signal types, different markets
- Core value: Access to cutting-edge mathematical research
