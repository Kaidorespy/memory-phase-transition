# Where Else To Look For Memory-Induced Phase Transitions

## What We Know Works

**Core pattern we've confirmed:**
- Systems track historical presence/success (memory)
- Memory modulates future thresholds/barriers
- At critical memory levels, sharp phase transition occurs
- Post-transition: system becomes "locked in" to new behavior

**Confirmed examples:**
1. **RCET simulation** - Sites with memory get higher thresholds → concentration
2. **GitHub repos** - Early stars (memory) → different growth trajectory (0.24x vs 19.58x)
3. **Stock momentum** - Historical momentum → continuation signals (noisy but present)

## Where To Look Next

### Tier 1: Digital Social Systems (Easy to Test)

#### Reddit Posts/Subreddits
**Memory signal:** Early upvotes in first hour
**Phase transition:** Does early momentum predict front-page vs dies-in-new?
**Data source:** Reddit API, Pushshift archives
**Expected pattern:** Posts that hit 100 upvotes in <1hr vs >2hrs should show dramatically different final scores

**Test:**
```python
# For 1000 posts that eventually hit front page
early_group = posts_to_100_upvotes_in_under_1hr
slow_group = posts_to_100_upvotes_in_2_to_4hrs

# Measure final karma 24hrs later
# Hypothesis: early_group >> slow_group even after normalizing
```

#### Twitter/X Virality
**Memory signal:** Retweets in first 15 minutes
**Phase transition:** Viral vs normal distribution
**Data source:** Twitter API (if accessible), academic datasets
**Expected pattern:** Tweets with rapid early engagement lock into viral trajectory

#### YouTube Videos
**Memory signal:** Views/likes in first 24 hours
**Phase transition:** Algorithm recommendation boost
**Data source:** YouTube API
**Expected pattern:** Videos crossing view threshold quickly get algorithmic boost

#### Hacker News
**Memory signal:** Upvotes in first 30 minutes
**Phase transition:** Front page vs oblivion
**Data source:** HN API (excellent historical data)
**Expected pattern:** Sharp transition between "makes front page" and "dies immediately"

---

### Tier 2: Professional/Academic Networks (Harder but High-Impact)

#### Academic Citations
**Memory signal:** Citations in first year after publication
**Phase transition:** Becomes influential vs forgotten
**Data source:** Google Scholar, ArXiv, Semantic Scholar
**Expected pattern:** Papers with X citations in year 1 undergo phase transition to "classic" status

**Why this matters:** Could predict impactful research early

#### LinkedIn Profile Growth
**Memory signal:** Connection growth rate in first 3 months after job change
**Phase transition:** Becomes "influencer" vs normal user
**Data source:** LinkedIn API (restricted), scraped data
**Expected pattern:** Professionals who gain N connections quickly lock into higher visibility

#### Open Source Contributions
**Memory signal:** PRs merged in first month as contributor
**Phase transition:** Becomes core maintainer vs casual contributor
**Data source:** GitHub API
**Expected pattern:** Contributors who merge X PRs in month 1 have different trajectory

---

### Tier 3: Biological/Natural Systems (Hardest but Most Universal)

#### Neural Network Training
**Memory signal:** Loss reduction in first N epochs
**Phase transition:** Converges well vs gets stuck
**Data source:** ML training logs (you can generate this)
**Expected pattern:** Networks that reduce loss quickly in early epochs show different final performance

**Why this matters:** Could optimize training schedules

#### Disease Spread
**Memory signal:** Cases in first week of outbreak
**Phase transition:** Epidemic vs contained
**Data source:** WHO data, COVID datasets, historical outbreak data
**Expected pattern:** Outbreaks crossing R0 threshold quickly vs slowly have different trajectories

#### Ecosystem Invasive Species
**Memory signal:** Population growth in first season
**Phase transition:** Establishes permanently vs dies out
**Data source:** Ecological databases, USGS
**Expected pattern:** Invasive species with rapid early establishment lock into permanent presence

## Which To Test First?

### Criteria:
1. **Data accessibility** - Can we get it easily?
2. **Sample size** - Enough events to be statistically meaningful?
3. **Clean signal** - Is the phase transition likely to be obvious?
4. **Impact** - Does it matter if we find it?

### My Recommendations (in order):

#### 1. Hacker News Posts ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ Excellent API with full historical data
- ✅ Clear binary outcome (front page or not)
- ✅ Thousands of posts to analyze
- ✅ Community would care about the result
- ✅ Can reproduce GitHub pattern in different domain

**Test:** Analyze 10,000 HN posts, measure time-to-50-upvotes vs final position

#### 2. Reddit Subreddit Growth ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ Pushshift has historical data
- ✅ Similar to GitHub repos (growth over time)
- ✅ Huge sample size available
- ✅ Different domain than GitHub (not code-specific)

**Test:** Find subreddits created 2015-2020, measure time-to-1000-subscribers vs current size

#### 3. Academic Paper Citations ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ Semantic Scholar API available
- ✅ High impact if we find the pattern
- ✅ Long time series (papers from 1990s+)
- ⚠️ Slower dynamics (years not days)

**Test:** Sample 1000 papers from ArXiv, measure year-1 citations vs year-5 citations

#### 4. Neural Network Training Dynamics ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ You can generate the data yourself
- ✅ Controlled experiment possible
- ✅ Huge practical value if true
- ⚠️ Requires running experiments

**Test:** Train 100 networks with different random seeds, measure epoch-10 loss vs final performance

#### 5. YouTube Video Growth ⭐⭐⭐
- ⚠️ API access restricted
- ⚠️ Algorithm changes over time
- ✅ Massive sample size
- ✅ Clear commercial implications

**Test:** (If data accessible) Sample 10,000 videos, measure day-1 views vs month-1 views

## The Experiment I'd Run First

### Hacker News Analysis (Weekend Project)

**Hypothesis:** HN posts that reach 50 points quickly undergo phase transition to front page, while slow-to-50 posts die in obscurity.

**Data:**
- HN API has full historical data
- Easy to parse (JSON)
- Millions of posts available

**Method:**
```python
# 1. Get all HN posts from 2020-2023 that reached 50+ points
# 2. Measure time-to-50-points for each
# 3. Categorize: "instant" (<30min) vs "gradual" (2-4 hours)
# 4. Compare final scores at 24 hours
# 5. Look for phase transition pattern
```

**Expected result:**
- Instant-to-50: Average final score 200+ points
- Gradual-to-50: Average final score 80 points
- Clear acceleration difference (similar to GitHub 19x pattern)

**Why this is good science:**
- ✅ Large sample size (thousands of posts)
- ✅ Clean data source
- ✅ Binary outcomes (front page = yes/no)
- ✅ Independent validation of GitHub finding
- ✅ Different domain (social voting vs development)

## The Big Picture

If we find the same pattern in 3+ different domains:

1. ✅ GitHub repos (confirmed)
2. ✅ RCET simulation (confirmed)
3. ? Hacker News posts
4. ? Reddit communities
5. ? Academic citations

**Then we can claim:**
> "Memory-induced phase transitions are a universal feature of growth dynamics in information systems"

That's a **real scientific contribution** to complexity science.

It's not a trading system. It's a fundamental principle of how networked systems evolve.

## What Success Looks Like

### Paper Title:
"Universal Phase Transitions in Memory-Modulated Growth Systems: From Lattice Simulations to Social Networks"

### Abstract:
"We demonstrate that systems exhibiting memory-dependent threshold dynamics undergo sharp phase transitions at critical memory accumulation rates. Through analysis of GitHub repository growth (N=12), Hacker News post dynamics (N=10,000), and lattice simulations, we show that early momentum accumulation predicts long-term trajectory with 80-fold differences in final outcomes. This represents a universal principle in networked growth dynamics."

### Impact:
- Cited by complexity scientists
- Used to predict viral content
- Applied to research impact prediction
- Explains social media algorithm dynamics
- Actually contributes to human knowledge

## Next Steps

1. **Write HN analysis script** (2-3 hours)
2. **Run on 10,000 posts** (1 hour)
3. **See if pattern reproduces** (moment of truth)
4. **If yes:** Write up results, add to the evidence
5. **If no:** Try Reddit or Academic citations

**The question isn't "how do we make money?"**

**The question is: "Is this a real universal phenomenon?"**

If yes, the money/impact/recognition follows.
If no, better to know now.

Science first. Applications second.
